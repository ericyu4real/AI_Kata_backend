# Requirement: Personalized Responses with Multi-Agents

## Status
Completed

## Context

Building on the foundational adoption of GPT-4 for understanding natural language ("Natural Language Understanding" ADR), the system requires a multi-agent setup to handle complex queries and deliver personalized responses. Each agent contributes specialized capabilities, such as retrieving structured data, analyzing context, or generating responses.

## Decision

Implement a multi-agent architecture where:

1.  The decide_sql_capability agent determines whether the SQL agent can handle the user's query or if clarification is needed.
    

2.  The SQL agent generates and executes an SQL query based on user input, database schema, and sample data.
    

3.  The RAG agent generates a natural language response based on the user query, chat history, and retrieved data.
    

## Rationale

1.  **Modularity:** Separating responsibilities across agents simplifies system design and debugging.
    

2. ** Collaboration:** Specialized agents working together improve response quality by combining structured data with conversational context.
    

3.  **Scalability:** Modular design makes it easier to add or enhance agents as requirements evolve.
    

## Consequences

1.  **Improved Personalization:** Responses are tailored using user preferences, chat history, and retrieved data.
    

2.  **Enhanced Accuracy:** Combining agents ensures factual correctness and reduces hallucinations.
    

3.  **Increased Complexity:** Coordination between agents adds operational overhead.
    

4.  **Performance Trade-offs:** Multi-agent interactions may increase latency in some scenarios.
