# Requirement: Multi-Turn Dialogues with Cache

## Status
Completed

## Context

The application needs to support multi-turn conversations where the user and the system exchange information over several interactions. A caching mechanism (front-end cache) ensures efficient handling of conversation context.

## Decision

Implement a system that integrates chat history into the query generation process, enabling continuity across multiple dialogue turns. Cache conversation history at the front end for faster processing.

## Rationale

1.  **Improved Experience:** Multi-turn dialogues improve the user experience by providing contextually relevant answers across interactions.
    

2.  **Efficiency:** Front-end caching reduces latency and improves system efficiency.
    

3.  **User Experience:** Using chat history aligns with user expectations for natural and intuitive conversations.
    

## Consequences

1.  **Positive Impact:** Improved system responsiveness and continuity in dialogues.
    

2.  **Challenge:** Additional overhead to manage and cache conversation history effectively.
    

3.  **Dependency:** Reliance on the quality and size of cached data for accurate responses.
