# Requirement: Database Integration with SQL Database

## Status
Completed

## Context

The project needs a solution to handle structured data efficiently, support relational queries, and enable scalable data storage. SQLite was chosen for this use case due to its simplicity and suitability for lightweight applications.

## Decision

Integrated the project with SQLite, leveraging Python's SQLAlchemy library to handle database interactions.

## Rationale

1.  **Simplicity:** SQLite provides a lightweight, zero-configuration database solution.
    

2.  **Efficiency:** Supports SQL-based queries for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
    

3.  **Robustness:** Offers robust features like ACID compliance, indexing, and relational data handling.
    

## Consequences

1.  Improved data management and query efficiency.
    

2.  Simplifies scaling to more sophisticated databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) if needed in the future.
    

3.  Requires additional setup for database initialization and maintenance compared to CSV.
    

4.  Introduces dependency on the SQLite library.
