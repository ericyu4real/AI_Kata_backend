# Requirement: Natural Language Understanding

## Status
Completed

## Context

To build an online e-commerce chatbot, the first and foremost step is to leverage  AI models to understand user input before moving on to the next steps. After conducting research, we have identified OpenAI’s GPT models, especially GPT-4, as a potential solution to this requirement.

## Decision

We will adopt OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to proceed with this project.

## Rationale

1.  **Simplicity:** OpenAI provides an easy-to-use API for GPT-4 that can simplify the initial setup and implementation.
    

2.  **High-performance:** OpenAI’s GPT-4 model has been proved to be one of the most accurate models in natural language understanding.
    

3.  **Flexibility:** OpenAI’s GPT-4 model is highly adaptable and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, making it suitable for a wide range of natural language understanding applications.
    

## Consequences

1.  **Improved User Experience:** The chatbot will be able to understand and respond to user queries more accurately, leading to a better user experience.
    

2.  **Scalability:** With the use of a powerful LLM like GPT-4, user intents can be detected automatically through natural language understanding, leading to an improved scalability and generalizability.
    

3.  **Futureproofing:** By adopting a state-of-the-art model, the system will be better positioned to integrate future advancements in AI and natural language processing.
